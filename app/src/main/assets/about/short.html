<h2>Welcome to the MECCG Community App for Android!</h2>
<p>This is an open source Android app and the source code is available on GitHub under the GPL-2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not programmed this app to collect ANY data, personal or not. Only if the app crashes would data ever be collected, and this is done automatically by Android & Google.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any security vulnerability concerns or have any questions whatsoever, please send me an email and I will do my best to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check out the About/Legal section of this app for further information.<br>&nbsp;</p>
